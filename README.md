This project is a complete end-to-end deep learning solution for detecting and segmenting oil spills in satellite imagery. It uses a U-Net model built with PyTorch to perform semantic segmentation, classifying each pixel as either "oil spill" or "no spill". The trained model is deployed in a real-time, interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Accurate Segmentation:** Utilizes a U-Net architecture, achieving a high Intersection over Union (IoU) score of **0.88** on the test set.
- **Binary Classification:** Classifies images as either "Oil Spill Detected" or "No Spill Detected" based on the segmentation output.
- **Interactive Web App:** A user-friendly Streamlit application allows users to upload their own images and receive instant predictions.
- **Visual Overlay:** The predicted spill mask is displayed as a semi-transparent, colored overlay on the original image for clear and intuitive visualization.
- **Portable Model:** The final model is exported to the ONNX format, making it ready for cross-platform deployment (e.g., in the Unity engine).

## üì∏ Screenshots

Here is the model in action, correctly identifying a spill and clearing an image with no spill.

#### Positive Detection (Oil Spill)

![Oil Spill Detected](https://github.com/abhiramavarma/AI_SpillGuard_OSD-AbhiramaVarma_Nandayala/blob/main/images/oil_spill.png)
*The model correctly identifies the oil spill and overlays the segmented area in red.*

#### Negative Detection (No Spill)

*The model correctly classifies this image as having no spill, ignoring challenging features like sun glint.*
